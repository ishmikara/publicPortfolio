        I've accepted this will be a grade of zero.
        Barely out of week 2 and I've already hit the mental self-sabotage button.
        This isn't school where I can BS my way through.
        This isn't work where I know almost everything.
        My dishonesty was highly inappropriate... I apologize.
        This is a childhood dream of mine.
        I should not expect perfection from myself.
        I'm not expected to know everything.
        Mistakes are expected.
        But I should know better.
        And I should <b>definitely</b> be doing better.
        This is a mental kick in the toukus.
        A hard re-boot.
        There will be no further missed or partial submissions.
        110% from here on out.
        If allowed this opportunity, I <i>will</i> finish this boot camp.
